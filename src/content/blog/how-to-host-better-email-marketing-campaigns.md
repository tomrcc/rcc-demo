### Double opt-in

Before you send out any campaign using an email marketing tool, make sure that you have permission from your subscribers to send them emails. You can do this by asking them during signup or including a checkbox in the subscription form asking if they'd like to receive marketing communications from you in the future.

Use double opt-in when sending out marketing emails. This means that the recipient must have previously agreed to receive emails from you before they can see content in their inboxes or on their mobile devices. This helps prevent people from signing up for newsletters they don't want and can help protect against spam complaints from users who didn't know they had signed up for something in the first place.
